# Syntropy Blockchain Integrations

This repository contains usable examples of how to connect your blockchain nodes through the Syntropy network. Most of the examples here are automated using Terraform and Ansible, meaning that they will only need a few commands to get up and running. When done, the node and its needed infrastructure will be connected through an encrypted tunnel, so that your blockchain network is stable, secure and performance-focused. 

Our goal is to produce open-source material that will immediately give developers a scaffolding to begin building on that blockchain. At our core, we facilitate networks. We provide developers with our work and research and give everyone detailed instructions on working within it. 

## Syntropy Stack for Blockchain

The Syntropy Stack provides a solution that abstracts the connection and encryption process to a level where a developer can focus on building components and rely on Syntropy to orchestrate & automate the connections necessary for the node to become viable.

You can use Terraform / Nomad to configure & containerize the network, and the Syntropy Agent installed on each component would be responsible for defining the connections between services. This gives you more autonomy to be provider agnostic, where you run these individual services and allow more resources to build core functionality rather than operational functionality.

## Syntropy Builders

This repository is part of a [Syntropy Builders program](https://www.syntropystack.com/build).

Syntropy Builders is a community enablement program for our most dedicated developer contributors. The program takes place in established working groups led by Syntropy’s developers and engineers.

We are open for your contributions to new integrations and use cases. Let’s talk on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NVjTeRGqKb).
